- Crossplatform: ImpLauncher is written in Java which makes it natively run on Windows, Linux and Mac. On non-Windows systems it will try and use Wine to start the game. 

- KeeperFX.net integration: The launcher window shows the latest workshop items and news from the KeeperFX.net website! Stay up to date with the latest changes involving KeeperFX! It also has a big Workshop button that opens the workshop in your browser.

- Updater: An automatic updater is implemented that asks you to update your game to the latest stable or alpha version. It will know what version you are using and will ask you to update when a new version is released. It will also add new cfg variables to the existing config so that your chosen settings will never be lost.

- Installer: The included installer can grab the required DK files from many different sources including the original CD, the GOG digital gold edition and even existing KeeperFX installations. It also has the ability to automatically copy over the background music from the Digital Gold edition. Besides that it will ask now ask you if you want to generate a suggested config file. (Automatically setup resolution, language and more)

- Crash reporter: When your game crashes you now can now choose to send a crash report to the developers. It grabs details about the crash and you can even include a save-file and write a description of the crash.

- Settings: The settings have been created in such a way that they are less technical and much easier to configure than the original launcher. Run-options and .cfg file variables have been combined which makes it much easier to configure.
